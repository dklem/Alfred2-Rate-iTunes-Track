# Description
An [Alfred 2](http://www.alfredapp.com) workflow designed to allow for easy access to rate the currently playing track in iTunes. 

# Installation
Only the "Rate iTunes Track.alfredworkflow" file is required to run the workflow. Added the bash scripts to keep track of changes since they are embedded in the workflow normally, and can't be seen on github or without Alfred installed. 

# Usage
Invoke Alfred 2, and type `rate <rating>` where `rating` is a number from 0-5. A selection of 0 clears the track rating, and 1-5 corresponds to the appropriate star rating.
